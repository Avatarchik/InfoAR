# InfoAR
An Augmented Reality App which you can use to scan a product and get product information.
This application allows you to scan products and get relevant information/instruction/advertisement in augmented reality for your product. <br>
Check out a quick video demo [here](https://youtu.be/GJhGjtjPExk).

# How to use?
1. You can upload details of your product through [here](http://geekyjock.me/InfoAR-AddProduct/).<br>
   To see how this form works, checkout [InfoAR-AddProduct](https://github.com/geekyJock8/InfoAR-AddProduct).
1. Once you've uploaded the details(Name, Images, Details) of your product. 
   You can either build the application or download the latest build from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11VXJ75b7uzTbT1_Pan313OruAZMLv7vC/view?usp=sharing).
1. Then just scan the your product in real world and you will see the results.

**Note**: *The UI is designed only for 1920X1080 resoultion. So, if you use a phone with different resolution, you'll probably see some weird results*. 

# How to Build?
This application used Unity *2018.4.4f1*. So, Make sure that you are not using an older version. 
The project is set to be built for Android but you can also build it for iOS with correct settings.<br>
It uses *ARCore Unity SDK v1.11*.
